      Over the past decade, demand for collision avoidance methods has surged due to the increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
     (UAVs) in commercial sectors (Canis, B., 2015). UAVs provide enhanced capabilities, boost productivity, reduce emissions, and 
     minimize risks while sharing airspace, benefiting the economy and society. This article offers a comparison and evaluation of 
     UAV collision avoidance techniques, analyzing their effectiveness and the advantages and disadvantages observed by military and 
     other groups. Ultimately, the Optimisation method proves to be the most efficient collision avoidance technique for UAVs.

       In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have several uses. UAVs, for example, are often used in disaster response, 
      agriculture, and cargo transportation, among other things. The number of UAV flying operations has dramatically expanded on a 
      global scale. As of October 1st 2024, 792,000 UAVs have been registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (Drones by the numbers).
      
       An unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without a human pilot, crew, or passengers on board (Fuller M., 2021). 
      According to the International Trade Administration (ITA), an unmanned aircraft system comprises air vehicles and associated equipment 
      that do not carry a human operator but instead are remotely piloted or fly autonomously (44, 2020). 
      Unmanned Aircraft Systems are composed of a UAV or drone, the person in charge of flight operations on the ground and the infrastructure 
      linking the two. Since it solely refers to the vehicle itself, the UAV refers to a part of the UAS. 
      The UAVs' anti-collision technologies are crucial to preserving their lifespan. Obstacle sensing, collision prediction, and collision 
      avoidance make up most UAV anti-collision technology techniques. By detecting its environment, a UAV can identify and find obstacles, 
      supplying information that can be used to anticipate collisions. The sensors in the UAV gather environmental data during detection, 
      such as the position and speed of obstacles. The UAV will determine whether it will collide with the obstacles during the collision 
      prediction process. If the UAV predicts a collision, it will plan its flight path to avoid it during the collision avoidance operation.

       I. <u>Optimisation Method</u>
       Bamboo's fiber composition consists of cell walls that are rich in long, aligned cellulose fibers that provide 
       significant resistance to pulling forces, making them strong in tension. Recent studies 
       <a href="https://www.guaduabamboo.com/blog/mechanical-properties-of-bamboo" target="_blank">show</a> 
       that their tensile strength ranges between 100-400 MPa, which is significantly higher than most construction grade timbers.
