  In recent years, the need for collision avoidance methods have increased due to the predicted rise of the use of UAVs in the 
commercial industry (as said by the department for science and technology) to offer new capabilities, increase 
productivity, lower emissions, and minimize danger to life while safely and fairly sharing airspace with other 
users in order to benefit the economy and larger society. This article covers a concise comparison and evaluation 
of the collision avoidance techniques for Unmanned Aerial vehicles which researches the most effective techniques 
while considering their assets and liabilities presented by their usage in recent years by the military or other 
unaffiliated groups. After analysing the information by the parameters of efficiency in different terrain, it is 
evident that the most effective collision avoidance technique is the optimisation method due to its high efficiency,
practicality and monetary value. In the context of this article, “UAV” refers to any unmanned aerial device, 
specifically drones.

<p class="ex1">

 An unmanned aerial vehicle commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, 
or passengers on board [1]. According to the Federal Aviation administration (FAA), an unmanned aircraft 
system is an unmanned aircraft and the equipment necessary for the safe and efficient operation of that 
aircraft. 
  
 Unmanned Aircraft Systems, often known as UAS, are composed of a UAV or drone and the person in charge 
of flight operations on the ground and the infrastructure linking the two. Since it solely
refers to the vehicle itself, the UAV refers to a part of the UAS. An unmanned aircraft is a component 
of a UAS. It is defined by statute as an aircraft that operates without the possibility of direct 
human intervention from within or on the aircraft. 
  
 In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have several uses. UAVs, for example, are frequently
used in disaster response, agriculture, and cargo transportation, among other things. The number of 
UAV flying operations has dramatically expanded on a global scale. Up until November 2020, 1.7 
million UAVs have been registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)[2]. In addition
to this, there were about 392,000 registered UAVs and 1.25 million hours (about 142 and a half years) 
of commercial UAV flying activities in 2019, according to the China Civil Aviation Working Conference 
in 2020[3]. Moreover, data indicates that in 2019, the size of the global UAV industry hit $9 billion 
(about $28 per person in the US) (about $28 per person in the US) (about $28 per person in the US). 
UAV anti-collision technologies have received a lot of interest because of the widespread use of 
UAVs and their goal to prevent collisions with other objects.
  
 The UAVs' anti-collision technologies are crucial to preserving their survivability. Obstacle sensing, 
collision prediction, and collision avoidance are the three techniques that make up most UAV 
anti-collision technology. By detecting its environment, a UAV can identify and locate impediments, 
supplying information that can be utilized to anticipate collisions. The sensors in the UAV gather 
environmental data during obstacle detection, such as the position and speed of obstacles. The UAV 
will determine whether it will collide with the obstacles during the collision prediction process. 
If the UAV anticipates a collision, it will immediately plan its flight path to avoid it during the 
collision avoidance operation. UAV anti-collision technology must overcome several obstacles.
